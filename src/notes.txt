Typescript:
It is superset of Javascript. More features then javascript, eg Types,Classes,Interfaces etc
Typescript Compiled to Javascript

Sections 2:
Basis:
How angular apps gets loaded?

index.html -> calls app component selector i.e; <app-root></app-root>
The bundle of the all the JS files in done.
In main.ts bootstraps the AppModule.
AppModules then bootstraps the AppComponent

========================================================================================
Component It is key fetaure of angular

Making an angular sample app
npm install -g @angular/cli   (If Angular CLI is not installed)
ng new my-dream-app
cd my-dream-app
ng serve

Module in Angular refers to a place where you can group the 
components, directives, pipes, and services, which are related to the application.

In case you are developing a website, the header, footer, left, center and the right section 
become part of a module.

To define module, we can use the NgModule. When you create a new project using the Angular â€“cli command,
 the ngmodule is created in the app.module.ts file by default

Data binding in Angular :

1) Output Data (from Typescript[Business Logic] to Tempalate[HTML])
Ex: String interpolation {{data}}
Property Binding : [property] = "data"

2) Event Binding(React to User Event) :
(event) = "expression"

3) Combination of two way binding :
[(ngModel)]="data"

Combination of property and event based binding 


Important: For Two-Way-Binding (covered in the next lecture) to work, you need to enable the ngModel  
directive. This is done by adding the FormsModule  to the imports[]  array in the AppModule.

You then also need to add the import from @angular/forms  in the app.module.ts file:

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
