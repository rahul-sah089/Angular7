Module in Angular refers to a place where you can group the 
components, directives, pipes, and services, which are related to the application.

In case you are developing a website, the header, footer, left, center and the right section 
become part of a module.

To define module, we can use the NgModule. When you create a new project using the Angular â€“cli command,
 the ngmodule is created in the app.module.ts file by default

Data binding in Angular :
1) Output Data (from Typescript[Business Logic] to Tempalate[HTML])
Ex: String interpolation {{data}}
Property Binding : [property] = "data"

2) Event Binding(React to User Event) :
(event) = "expression"

3) Combination of two way binding :
[(ngModel)]="data"
